## Assignment Requirements Translation and Problem-Solving Approach
> This assignment involves developing a Web application for a tourism company named "Aotearoa Tours Ltd (ATL)." The project is divided into two submission phases: Milestone Submission and Final Submission.
## 1. Milestone Submission
### Requirements:
* Create a private GitHub repository named atl and place the provided Web application files (e.g., app.py) in the main directory.
* Host the Web application on PythonAnywhere, ensuring that files are cloned from the GitHub repository and a MySQL database named atl is set up.
* Ensure that the / (home page) and /tours (tours page) routes are running correctly.
* Provide access for the instructor (GitHub and PythonAnywhere).

## 2. Final Submission
### Requirements:
Complete multiple functional modules of the Web application, including:
* Customer list display, customer search, adding/editing customers, and customer booking overview.
  - Adding images and introductory text to the home page.
  - Implementing booking functionality with age restrictions.
  - Using Bootstrap CSS for layout, ensuring a clean and professional interface.
* Write a project report documenting design decisions and database-related questions.
* Submit GitHub repository and PythonAnywhere links.

## 3. Problem-Solving Approach and Steps
### 3.1 Milestone Submission
* **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**
    - Log in to GitHub and create a private repository named atl.
    - Upload the provided Web application files (e.g., app.py, HTML templates) to the main directory of the repository.
    - Ensure a clear file structure for easy development.
* **Step 2: Configure PythonAnywhere**
  - Register and log in to PythonAnywhere.
  - Clone the GitHub repository to the home directory on PythonAnywhere.
  - Create a MySQL database named atl and import the provided SQL files to initialize the data.
  - Configure the Web application to ensure the / and /tours routes are running correctly.
* **Step 3: Provide Access**
  - Add the instructor's account (lincolnmac or computing@lincoln.ac.nz) as a collaborator to the GitHub repository.
  - Add the instructor as a "teacher" on PythonAnywhere.
* **Step 4: Submit Links**
  - Submit the GitHub repository link and the PythonAnywhere Web application link to the course platform.
### 3.2 Final Submission
* **Step 1: Develop the Web Application**
  - Home Page Design: Add appropriate images and introductory text to the home page, using Bootstrap for layout.
  - Customer List Functionality: Complete the tourlist.html template to display a list of customers for a specific tour group, sorted by surname, with links to customer details.
  - Booking Functionality: Implement the /booking/add route to allow users to book customers for future tours, considering age restrictions.
  - Customer Search Functionality: Create templates and routes to enable searching for customers by name and displaying search results.
  - Add/Edit Customer Functionality: Create templates and routes to allow adding/editing customer information with proper validation.
  - Customer Booking Overview: Create templates and routes to display a summary of customer bookings, including tour names and departure dates.
* **Step 2: Write the Project Report**
  - In the README.md file of the GitHub repository, document design decisions, database questions, and other relevant information using Markdown format.
  - Discuss design decisions, focusing on page structure, template reuse, and data interaction.
  - Answer database-related questions, such as creating tables and setting relationships.
* **Step 3: Testing and Optimization**
  - Test the Web application on both local and PythonAnywhere environments to ensure functionality.
  - Optimize code, ensuring well-formatted and well-documented HTML, SQL, and Python code.
  - Ensure a clean and professional interface, adhering to Bootstrap CSS standards.
* **Step 4: Final Submission**
  - Submit the GitHub repository link and PythonAnywhere link to the course platform.
  - Ensure the GitHub repository includes all code files, images, requirements.txt, and the README.md report.
## 4. Summary
This assignment requires students to develop a fully functional Web application involving customer management, booking systems, and data interaction. The project is divided into two submission phases, and students must complete code development, functional implementation, and project report writing within the specified timeframe. The problem-solving approach includes:
> 1. Completing the configuration and setup for the Milestone Submission phase.
> 2. Focusing on functional module development and user experience optimization in the Final Submission phase.
> 3. Writing a project report to document design decisions and database-related questions.
> 4. Strictly adhering to project constraints, ensuring code standards, clean interfaces, and using only the specified technologies (Python, Flask, Bootstrap, MySQL).

Through this project, students can consolidate their Web development skills while also practicing code organization, functional implementation, and documentation writing.
